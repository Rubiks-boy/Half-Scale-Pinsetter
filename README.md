The goal of this project is to eventually make a fully automatic half scale pinsetter for half scale bowling. This involves all aspects of picking up the pins, sweeping the pins, and circulating the knocked over pins in order to set them down on the lane once again. In addition, the device should be able to determine which pins are standing and determine accurate scoring based on that information.

There is a mechanical aspect of 3D modeling parts that can be printed and will not only work but also be durable enough to hold the pins. In addition, there are two programming aspects: an Arduino, which runs the motors and reads any sensors from the machine, and a scoring component made in Java. While I am currently testing the Java component on my laptop, I will eventually run this on a Raspberry Pi or another low-powered device. I plan to release the Java scoring for other small scale bowlers once I have a more stable and feature-packed software.
